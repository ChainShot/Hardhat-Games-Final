# Hardhat Games

In this repository you'll find all four of the games we went over and corresponding tests for each one.

If you want to run the tests simply run `npx hardhat test`.

## Want to build your own game?

Create a new contract and start building some test cases for it!

Once it's working as you expect, deploy the game to the testnet using `scripts/win.js` (`npx hardhat run scripts/win.js`) and challenge us to emit the `Winner` event!
